💡 Cantilever Internship Projects

Welcome to my internship project repository for *Cantilever*. This repo contains two machine learning projects assigned during the internship program:

1. 🧠 Sentiment Analysis System  
2. 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

All projects are implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab. These tasks showcase basic data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

 📘 Project 1: Sentiment Analysis System 

Goal: 
Analyze movie reviews and classify them as **positive** or **negative** using natural language processing (NLP).

Technologies Used:
- Python
- NLTK
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab

Steps Performed:
- Loaded movie review dataset from NLTK
- Preprocessed and vectorized text data
- Built a Naive Bayes classification model
- Evaluated accuracy and classification report

📗 Project 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Goal:
Detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data using machine learning and handle data imbalance.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Google Colab

Steps Performed:
- Loaded dataset (`creditcard.csv`)
- Applied SMOTE to handle imbalance
- Built a Random Forest classifier
- Evaluated performance using accuracy and precision/recall metrics
